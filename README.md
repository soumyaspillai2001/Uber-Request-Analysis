# Uber-Request-Analysis
Project aims to develop interactive and insightful dashboards for analyzing Uber cab requests by the customers. Key factors like demand, supply, date, time and status of booking, helps the company to provide supply and services as per increase in demand in office hours to avoid cab unavailability or cancellation of booking.
